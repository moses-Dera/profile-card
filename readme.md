# 🚀 Frontend Wizards — Stage 0 Task: Profile Card

This project is a submission for **Frontend Wizards Stage 0**, where I built a small, responsive, and accessible **Profile Card** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The Profile Card displays:
- A user avatar 🧑‍💻  
- Name and short biography ✍️  
- The current time in **milliseconds** (updated dynamically) ⏱️  
- Social links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn) 🌐  
- Lists of hobbies and dislikes 🎯  

Every element includes a unique `data-testid` attribute, as required for automated testing.
